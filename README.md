# Project-VIGOR
This project aims to develop a business prototype using a data-driven approach. 

The data source can be access via https://www.yelp.com.au/dataset/challenge

It contains almost 5 million reviews of over 150,000 businesses in 12 metro areas, along with data about 
features and “check in” times into the businesses.
